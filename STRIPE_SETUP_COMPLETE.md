# ✅ Stripe Payment Integration - Setup Complete

## What's Already Implemented

### ✅ API Routes (All Complete)
1. **`/api/stripe/create-payment-intent`** - Creates payment intent and payment record
2. **`/api/stripe/create-checkout-session`** - Creates Stripe Checkout Session for redirect
3. **`/api/stripe/webhook`** - Handles webhook events (checkout.session.completed, payment_intent.succeeded, payment_intent.payment_failed)

### ✅ Components (All Complete)
1. **`PaymentButton`** - Button component that redirects to Stripe Checkout
2. **`StripeCheckout`** - Embedded Stripe Elements form (alternative)

### ✅ Payment Calculation
- Implemented in `app/client/appointments/page.tsx`:
  ```typescript
  amount = (hourly_rate * duration_minutes) / 60
  ```

### ✅ Integration Points
- Client appointments page shows "Proceed to Payment" button for `awaiting_payment` status
- Payment success/failure handling with toast notifications
- Webhook updates payment and appointment status automatically
- Notifications sent to both client and lawyer on payment success

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Add Webhook Secret to `.env.local`

Add this line to your `.env.local` file:

```env
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_27fb530063b2bee8fbd616acadbad198afc458c955cce5ec887e4590c7d208b8
```

### 2. Configure Stripe Webhook (For Production)

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard > Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks)
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. Set endpoint URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
4. Select events to listen for:
   - ✅ `checkout.session.completed` (primary)
   - ✅ `payment_intent.succeeded` (fallback)
   - ✅ `payment_intent.payment_failed`
5. Copy the webhook signing secret (you already have it)

### 3. For Local Development Testing

If you want to test webhooks locally, use Stripe CLI:

```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
# Then run:
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
```

This will give you a webhook secret for local testing.

## Recent Fixes Applied

1. ✅ **Webhook now handles Checkout Sessions** - Added `checkout.session.completed` event handler
2. ✅ **Fixed lawyer_id in API routes** - Both routes now properly fetch lawyer_id
3. ✅ **Added notifications** - Client and lawyer get notified on payment success
4. ✅ **Fixed payment button** - Removed unreachable code after redirect
5. ✅ **Payment status handling** - Appointments page shows success/cancelled messages
